# Public-Projects

### Authors Note: ###
Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio! This repository features projects I've created to hone my skills in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and explore various aspects of Python development. Each project demonstrates my ability to use classes effectively and apply programming concepts to practical problems. While some of the projects I've worked in the beginning of my Python/ Programming education may be considered fairly basic and simple, I believe it's important to remember where we started and I keep it committed here as a reminder to look back at the progress I've made and to continue learning.

When you're ready, go ahead and fork some of the desired files/ applications for testing; note that some projects located in their own folders will need all files contained in the folder to work. For example, Pong has mutliple components each separate by its own file (Scoreboard.py will now workwithout main.py, etc.,).

Enjoy and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
Thank you!

Best wishes,

## üìö About Me

I'm a passionate Python developer with a focus on Cybersecurity; I intend to using this repository as a showcase of my growth and expertise. This portfolio reflects my commitment to learning, experimenting, and solving real-world challenges through code and new technologies. I do not consider myself and expert, but rather a practitioner that is consistently learning.
