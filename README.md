# **Public-Projects**

## **Author’s Note**

Welcome to my Python Projects Portfolio. This repository showcases projects that have helped me refine my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills and explore various aspects of Python development. These projects demonstrate practical applications of programming concepts, with a focus on problem-solving.

Early projects remain committed to this repository as a reference point for progress and learning. Some serve as useful guides for specific modules and implementations.

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with **containerized applications** and will continue adding finished projects to the **Docker directory**.

Fork and test any project, but note that some require multiple files to function properly (e.g., Pong’s `Scoreboard.py` and `main.py`).

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

- Expanding into data analysis, web scraping, and GUI development.
    
- Increasing scripting projects in PowerShell, Bash, and Python.
  
- Experimenting with LLMs such as Llama-3, GPT4, Claude, and other architectures

- Considering updates to homelab with Dev Containers, Docker Desktop, Github Codespaces, and GitPod

- Securing containerized applications during development, deployment, and runtime.

## **About Me**

I’m a Python developer with an interest in **cybersecurity, automation, and problem-solving**. This repository is both a portfolio and a reference for continuous learning.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, playing board games, and experimenting with new technology. I focus on **practical development** rather than theory alone, and I believe in constant improvement through hands-on experience.
