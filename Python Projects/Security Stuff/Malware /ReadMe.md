# Malware Projects Repository

## Updates:
### Key Changes and Improvements:
#### Refactored Logic:

Wrapped functionality into separate functions (find_files, encrypt_files, decrypt_files) for modularity and reusability.
The main() function handles the high-level flow and user interaction.
Error Handling:

Added checks to ensure the decryption key file (thekey.key) exists before trying to decrypt files.
User input is validated to ensure they provide either "encrypt" or "decrypt".
Dynamic Exclusion:

Automatically excludes the script itself and the key file when looking for files to encrypt/decrypt.
User Interaction:

Allows the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
Added a secret phrase for decryption for additional security.
Code Readability:

Fixed indentation, syntax errors, and formatting issues.
Used consistent variable naming and added comments for clarity.

#### Educational Use Reminder:
The script now contains a clear educational disclaimer.
